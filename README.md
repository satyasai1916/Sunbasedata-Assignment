let's summarize the project:

**Project Overview:**
This is a Java Spring Boot web application that interacts with an external API to manage customer data. It has several key components, including authentication, customer listing, customer creation, customer update, and customer deletion.

**Project Components:**
1. **Authentication:**
   - Users can log in using their credentials (login_id and password).
   - Upon successful login, the application receives a Bearer token that is used to authenticate subsequent API calls.
   - The Bearer token is stored in the `AuthService`.

2. **Customer Listing:**
   - After authentication, users are redirected to the `customer-list.html` page.
   - The application makes a GET request to an external API to retrieve a list of customers.
   - The retrieved customer data is displayed on the page.
   - For each customer, there are options to update or delete them.

3. **Customer Creation:**
   - Users can navigate to the `create-customer.html` page.
   - They can fill in details for a new customer, including first name, last name, and other optional attributes.
   - Upon submission, a POST request is sent to create the new customer via an external API.
   - Success or failure is handled with appropriate error messages.

4. **Customer Update:**
   - Users can choose to update a specific customer on the `customer-list.html` page.
   - They are directed to the `update-form.html` page.
   - The existing customer data is pre-filled.
   - Upon submission, a POST request is sent to update the customer via an external API.

5. **Customer Deletion:**
   - Users can delete a specific customer on the `customer-list.html` page.
   - A DELETE request is sent to remove the selected customer via an external API.
   - Success or failure is handled with appropriate error messages.

**Project Files:**
The project involves creating various files, including controllers, services, HTML templates, and configuring dependencies in the `pom.xml` file. Here are some of the key files involved:
- `AuthController` and `AuthService` for user authentication.
- `CustomerController` and `CustomerService` for managing customer data.
- HTML templates: `login.html`, `customer-list.html`, `update-form.html`, and `create-customer.html`.

Please note that this is a simplified example, and real-world projects may involve additional features, validation, and security measures.

Here's a summary of what each part does:

Customer.java: Represents the customer data model with the necessary properties and getters/setters.

CustomerController.java: Manages customer-related operations, such as creating, updating, and deleting customers. It also handles displaying the list of customers.

CustomerService.java: Contains the business logic for customer operations and communicates with the REST API. It provides error handling for each operation.

AuthService.java: Manages the Bearer token and stores it upon successful login.

AuthController.java: Handles user authentication and stores the Bearer token in AuthService.

login.html: The login page for user authentication.

customer-list.html: Displays the list of customers and provides options for updating, deleting, and creating customers.

update-form.html: The form for updating customer details.

create-customer.html: The form for creating a new customer.
